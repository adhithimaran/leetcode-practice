Stuck?
- bruteforce
- think of other DS or alg to use
- communicate to make sure you're on track

Notes:
- Simplify the Problem:
    Input -> ... -> Output
    - the input are ..., we do ... to the inputs, and finally, we get ... as the output
    - catch edge cases
- Pattern Recognition:
    - Big O
    - Algorithms + Data Structures
    - walk through most obvious answer (even if not efficient, get Big O notation)
    - identify optimal solution
        - check constraints
        - look for hints and context of problems to find this
- Implementation + Coding
    - practice various patterns often and customize based on problem
    - e.g. BFS 
- Debug
    - Implementation Error 
    - Syntax Error
    - Add print statements to get better visibility
