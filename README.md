```

## Quick Start

### First Time Setup

1. **Standardize your filenames** (optional but recommended):
```bash
# See what would change
python rename_files.py --dry-run

# Apply changes
python rename_files.py
```

2. **Import existing problems**:
```bash
python scan_and_add.py
```

3. **Check your progress**:
```bash
python tracker.py list
python tracker.py stats
```

## 📝 Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine
```bash
# Check what needs review today
python workflow.py daily
```

### Adding a New Problem
```bash
# Format: python workflow.py add <number> "<name>" <topic> <difficulty>
python workflow.py add 16 "Three Sum Closest" two-pointers medium

# This will:
# 1. Create a new file in the correct folder
# 2. Add it to the tracker
# 3. Commit to git automatically
```

### After Solving/Reviewing
```bash
# Update status: redo, review, or confident
python workflow.py review 16 confident

# This will:
# 1. Update tracker with new status
# 2. Increment attempt count
# 3. Commit to git automatically
```

## Manual Commands

### Tracker Commands

```bash
# List all problems
python tracker.py list

# List only problems that need redo
python tracker.py list --status redo

# Show problems due for review
python tracker.py review

# Show statistics
python tracker.py stats

# Manually add a problem
python tracker.py add 42 "Trapping Rain Water" --status redo --difficulty hard --tags "two-pointers,stack"

# Update a problem
python tracker.py update 42 --status confident --notes "Finally got it!"
```

### Git Commands

```bash
# See uncommitted changes
git status

# Push your progress
git push

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```

## Status System

Your problems are tracked with three statuses:

- **redo** (🔴): Need to practice again soon
  - Review in: 1 day
  
- **review** (🟡): Understand but need occasional practice
  - Review in: 7 days
  
- **confident** (🟢): Mastered the problem
  - Review in: 30 days

## 📂 Topic Folders

When adding problems, use these topic keywords (they map to folders):

| Keywords | Folder |
|----------|--------|
| `array`, `arrays`, `hash`, `hashing` | arrays-hashing |
| `backtrack` | backtracking |
| `binary` | binary-search |
| `linked`, `list` | linked-list |
| `matrix` | matrix |
| `window`, `sliding` | sliding-window |
| `stack` | stack |
| `tree`, `trees` | trees |
| `pointer`, `pointers` | two-pointers |

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: New Problem Flow
```bash
# Start your day
python workflow.py daily

# Add a new problem you're working on
python workflow.py add 121 "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" array easy

# ... solve it in the created file ...

# Mark as confident after solving
python workflow.py review 121 confident
```

### Example 2: Review Flow
```bash
# Check what needs review
python workflow.py daily

# You see problem #15 needs review
# ... redo the problem ...

# If you struggled, keep as redo
python workflow.py review 15 redo

# If you got it easily, mark confident
python workflow.py review 15 confident
```

### Example 3: Just Checking Progress
```bash
# See everything
python tracker.py list

# See just the tough ones
python tracker.py list --status redo

# See your stats
python tracker.py stats
```

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition Schedule

The tracker automatically schedules reviews based on your confidence:

```
First attempt (redo)
    ↓ (1 day later)
Review again
    ↓ if confident
Confident status
    ↓ (30 days later)
Review again to maintain
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem: Git merge conflicts in leetcode_progress.json**
```bash
# Keep your version
git checkout --ours leetcode_progress.json
git add leetcode_progress.json
```

**Problem: Accidentally deleted leetcode_progress.json**
```bash
# Restore from git
git checkout HEAD -- leetcode_progress.json
```

**Problem: Want to start fresh**
```bash
# Delete progress file and re-scan
rm leetcode_progress.json
python scan_and_add.py
```

## 📈 Tracking Your Progress

Your `leetcode_progress.json` file tracks:
- Problem number and name
- Current status (redo/review/confident)
- Number of attempts
- Last review date
- Next scheduled review
- Difficulty and tags
- Personal notes

**This file is committed to git**, so your progress history is preserved!

## 🎓 Tips for Success

1. **Be honest with status updates** - If you struggled, mark as `redo`
2. **Do your daily checks** - Run `python workflow.py daily` each morning
3. **Add notes** - Use `--notes` to remember what was tricky
4. **Review old problems** - Don't just chase new problems
5. **Commit regularly** - The automation handles this, but double-check with `git status`
